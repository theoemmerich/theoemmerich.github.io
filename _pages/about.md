**About me** 
<div style="text-align: justify;">

I am a CNRS Principal investigator managing a lab at Ecole Normale Superieur(ENS) of Lyon. During my Ph.D. and postdoc, I contributed to the opening of a new research field: brain-inspired nanofluidics. It consists in implementing brain-like computations by relying on nanoscale fluidic channels filled with liquid electrolytes. This research direction is motivated by the high energy-efficiency of the brain (that operates with water and salts) relative to modern computers in a context of increase of computing power and decreasing amount of material and ressources. To advance in this direction, I am relying on disruptive nanopore technological developement using material and techniques coming from condensed matter physics and CMOS technology.
